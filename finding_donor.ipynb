    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $50,000$, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than $50,000$. This can greatly affect _accuracy_ since we could simply say _\"this person does not make more than $50,000$\"_ and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than $50,000$, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Please note** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adaboost <br>\n",
    "- Adaboost is an ensemble learning method to increase the efficiency of binary classifiers. It uses an iterative approach to learn from the mistakes of weak classifiers, and turn them into strong ones. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers added at each round of boosting are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost can be applied on top of any classifier to learn from its shortcomings and propose a more accurate model. It is usually called the “best out-of-the-box classifier” for this reason. It can be used in predicting customer churn rate; predicting how college wide receivers will do in the NFL and in facial recognition. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaboost is fast, simple and easy to program. It provides both explanatory power and precision. Unlike algorithms such as SVM, there is less need for tweaking parameters. As the parameters are not jointly optimized, it might be less prone to overfitting. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, since the boosting technique learns progressively, it is important to ensure the data quality. AdaBoost is also sensitive to noise and outlier in the data, therefore it is important to preprocess the data. If a complex model is used as the base classifier, this can lead to overfitting on the training data. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Boosting <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "- Gradient boosting is a generalization of AdaBoost. Both AdaBoost and Gradient Boost learn sequentially from a weak set of learners. However for gradient boosting, instead of adding any weights to predictors, wrong predicted datapoints are considered as a new training set and the new predictor tries to fit these data points making a new model; instead of training on a newly sampled distribution, the weak learner trains on the remaining errors of the strong learner. It is another way to give more importance to the difficult instances. It can be used in identifying anomalies in the context of cybersecurity. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient boosting produces predictive accuracy even with unbalanced data. It offers flexibility since you can optimize on different loss functions and it provides several hyper parameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible. You do not need to massively pre-process the data, and missing data are properly handled. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, the flexibility can also be a curse, as these parameters interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach. This means a grid search is needed for tuning. If the data is noisy, gradient boosting is sensitive to overfitting, because the algorithm improves itself by minimizing all errors. And it could take quite long since the trees are built sequentially. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> AdaBoost could be a good candidate as the dataset is clean and quite large, the algorithm itself is an \"enhanced\" version of classifier. I chose Gradient Boost as a comparison to AdaBoost to see the outcome based on different ways of treating errors. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines (SVM) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you have classified data represented by vectors of features, SVM divides data according to which side of a hyperplane in feature space each point lies. SVM can be used to classify data based on a set of numerical features. The support vectors are the coordinates of individual observation. The SVM classifier is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyperplane/line). SVM can be used in identifying plant types from features of their petals, estimating the risk of prostate cancer from MRI images, finding likely customers from subjects mentioned in their twitter posts. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unique strength of SVM lies in the kernel trick. The SVM kernel is a function that takes low dimensional input space and transforms it to a higher dimensional space, meaning it convers non-separable problem to separable problem. SVM works really well with a clear margin of separation; and it is effective in high dimensional spaces. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM is a black box. It is difficult to understand and interpret the model. As the support vector classifier works by putting data points, above and below the classifying hyperplane, there is no probabilistic explanation for the classification. Since the model is not easy to see, we cannot do small calibrations to the model. And it is difficult to visualize the impact. The kernel trick is powerful, yet choosing an \"appropriate\" kernel is not trivial. If the dataset is large, the training time could be very long. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> I chose SVM on the data, because it works well when the data has high dimensions - there are 103 features after the one-hot encoding. Additionally the dataset has less than 100,000 entries which should not be overwhelming for the computation."

AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting come from the same \"root\" and the performance is tied. When looking at each sample size, Gradient Boosting produced a higher accuracy score and F-score than AdaBoost on all samples except for the accuracy score on the testing set when the full sample is used, where the two models had the same score. Gradient Boost took slightly longer time than AdaBoost when training the full sample, this disadvantage disappeared when testing the full sample.\n",

    "In Machine Learning, Gradient Boosting belongs to the cohort of ensemble learners. The world \"ensemble\" reveals the idea that we are putting certain things together to accomplish something else. In the context of Machine Learning, it involves combining _\"weaker\"_ models through certain ways (boosting) to create a _\"stronger\"_ model. The \"weaker\" models could be, for example, the __decision tree__, which is similar to playing 20 questions. As the one in *Friends* Joey and Phoebe played on the road from Vegas. <br><br>\n",

    "In this game the trick is to figure out what are the best Yes/No questions to ask at each stage to get the answer as quickly as possible (Another good example would be when Raj asked Sheldon \"Are you Spock?\"). In Machine Learning, you have a training set of data that has been classified through features, and this is the data set used to construct the best possible tree structure of questions and answers so that when there is a new item to classify it can be done quickly and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Boosting__ originated from the idea that these weak learners (questions asked) could be modified to become better. \"Gradient\" is the algorithm behind this modification. Basically it checks the misclassified outcome and builds another tree that aims to correct the error produced by the previous tree and _at the same time_ tries to minimizing the number of errors of the model itself. This then becomes a sequential process and keeps running until we have reached a predefined error level that we can accept. Then we have a final model that is stronger than indivual tree before.\n",

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

As the examples made during the class, the objective is different whether it is about a medical trial or classifying spam email.
